      <description>Only thing going on here is a loop that sources all files in ~/.bash/ . I just upgraded Mint and it was kind enough to overwrite my .bashrc, that made me decide to have it as minimal as possible so I can easily restore it if something similar happens.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much about distros and I have not had any problems with Mint till this happened. But it is so poor design to overwrite .</description>
