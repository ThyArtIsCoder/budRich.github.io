      <description>Or, how I became a tiler i3 is a dynamic window manager for X. I use i3, and I really like it. There are many similar window managers and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried many of them. I have run and tinkered with bug.n on windows and tested awesome and dwm on GNU/Linux.
Maybe I was unlucky and had bad timing with awesome, I was very fresh on GNU/Linux and I think the awesome project was in a transition phase, but I had a hard time grasping all of it.</description>

      <description>You can probably install i3 directly from your distributions package manager. But If you want to be sure to get the latest version or a fork you need to download and compile the source code.
i3-gaps i3-gaps is a fork of i3 developed by Airblader who happens to be one of the main developers on vanilla/normal i3. i3-gaps has some features that is not 100% in sync with the design philosophy of normal i3, that&amp;rsquo;s why it is a fork.</description>

      <description>compton is a lightweight compositor for X that works really well with i3. A compositor adds some eye-candy like transparency and drop-shadows to the windows. But it also do some anti screen tearing magic and such. The compton setup can however be a bit tricky and it all depends on your own preferences and hardware.
Below are some snippets from my .compton.conf that is more i3 then hardware related that you might find useful:</description>
