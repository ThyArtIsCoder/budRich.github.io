      <description>dmenu is one of my favorite tools. It is a very simple program that displays a menu. It is often used as a lightweight launcher. But I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it is also the most efficient way to send user input to shell scripts, without having the user using a clumsy terminal command.
It is maintained by suckless, a group that have many interesting tools, programs and ideas.
I often use dmenu with my own scripts, and will describe how, in future articles.</description>
