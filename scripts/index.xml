      <description>This is a script I wrote to automate the process of uploading scripts and dotfiles to this web site.
It analyzes the title of Sublime Text to get the filename of the currently open file.
If the file is in ~/bin (my local scripfolder), it is a scriptfile, else it is a dotfile. Depending on the type it is sent to different directories within my hugo project folder. Which is on my Dropbox.</description>
