      <description>I have a quite odd dunst setup. The file dunst/mondo is generated with mondo and contains the color definitions for dunst. By default i merge the mondo file with dunst/lo-bar . But I have a script that can merge the mondo file with a different file and by doing so creating a temporary alternative notification layout.
lo-bar This layout displays a notification that only contains the summary (%s) in one line.</description>
