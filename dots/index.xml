      <description>Only thing going on here is a loop that sources all files in ~/.bash/ . I just upgraded Mint and it was kind enough to overwrite my .bashrc, that made me decide to have it as minimal as possible so I can easily restore it if something similar happens.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much about distros and I have not had any problems with Mint till this happened. But it is so poor design to overwrite .</description>

      <description>This is part of my anti-DM suite. The stuff I want to happen just before i3 loads up, goes here. Having urxvt in daemon mode is really nice. And I use xsetroot and a solid &amp;ldquo;greyed&amp;rdquo; color from Xresources instead of a wallpaper. I have written a little piece about the strange keyboard layout Seba. There is also a short text on why i use sxhkd.</description>
