      <description>This site is made using the static site generator Hugo and the text editor Sublime Text, using GNU/Linux as an IDE.
I wanted a static site because cutting edge web development techniques and bloated IDE&amp;rsquo;s is not an environment I like. I have promised myself that the rendered site should only be HTML/CSS (except for google analytics and disqus). There is a lot of crazy stuff and bash scripting involved in creating the site, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the finished site or your RAM and bandwidth usage.</description>

      <description>My name is Nils. I live in Sweden and I play the blues. I have worked the majority of my adult life as a CNC-operator/programmer in the steel industry. As all jobs it has it&amp;rsquo;s pros and cons.
I also made an attempt in the telecom industry, as a technical support agent for Lenovo.
But now I am looking for some other way to earn a living.
I have been very interested in computers ever since I got a C64 back in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>These are the steps I take to setup my work environment on a fresh install of Peppermint OS 8. Most of the steps are valid on other GNU/Linux distributions, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend anyone to blindly follow and install everything.
Before doing anything else i start syncing Dropbox. I start with this step because it can take up to 45 minutes, so while Dropbox is syncing there is time to install and setup other programs.</description>

      <description>I have tried many different ways to organize my files. I think the current setup I have is by far the best. It uses Dropbox to ensure cloud based backup and Hugo to create this site you are looking at where many of my actual dotfiles and scripts are viewable and auto-updated.
folder structure This might look overcomplicated and hard to setup, but it actually makes a lot of sense and takes no time to setup.</description>

      <description>A while ago I got irritated how messy my i3 config file looked, and I researched alternative hotkey managers. I tried sxhkd and it is a fine piece of code. I got a much cleaner setup of the hotkeys and I could do stuff that i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to do with i3.
But a couple of days ago, i realized that my i3 config could be just as clean as sxhkd by using variables.</description>

      <description>when I was working as a technical support agent I received several calls from angry men who couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the @ symbol on the keyboard. When I explained that they had to hold Alt-Gr and pressing 2 at the same time, they exploded with anger and told me to tell the technicians to make a new keyboard layout! I explained it&amp;rsquo;s an old standard and agreed it was stupid, but that it would probably never change.</description>

      <description>Or, how I became a tiler i3 is a dynamic window manager for X. I use i3, and I really like it. There are many similar window managers and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried many of them. I have run and tinkered with bug.n on windows and tested awesome and dwm on GNU/Linux.
Maybe I was unlucky and had bad timing with awesome, I was very fresh on GNU/Linux and I think the awesome project was in a transition phase, but I had a hard time grasping all of it.</description>

      <description>You can probably install i3 directly from your distributions package manager. But If you want to be sure to get the latest version or a fork you need to download and compile the source code.
i3-gaps i3-gaps is a fork of i3 developed by Airblader who happens to be one of the main developers on vanilla/normal i3. i3-gaps has some features that is not 100% in sync with the design philosophy of normal i3, that&amp;rsquo;s why it is a fork.</description>

      <description>It is easy to get used to bad font rendering. But there are some simple steps one can take to get great looking fonts on *GNU/*Linux.
Below is a summary of an article on binarytides, with some spice.
download the following fonts from
http://www.google.com/fonts/
 Droid Sans Droid Sans Mono Droid Serif Noto Sans Noto Serif Open Sans  Unzip &amp;lsquo;em and place them in ~/.fonts Download and place this .</description>

      <description>dmenu is one of my favorite tools. It is a very simple program that displays a menu. It is often used as a lightweight launcher. But I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it is also the most efficient way to send user input to shell scripts, without having the user using a clumsy terminal command.
It is maintained by suckless, a group that have many interesting tools, programs and ideas.
I often use dmenu with my own scripts, and will describe how, in future articles.</description>

      <description>This is another keyplayer in the anti-DM suit.
The read -rsn1 -t2 input waits two seconds for a key-press before it starts X and i3. If I press 1 I stay in the wonderful tty environment. If I press 3 lightDM is launched and I enter my normal Peppermint OS desktop. If I press 2 or wait 2 seconds, i3 starts. Before this happens I have to login, in text mode and look at my issue.</description>

      <description>Only thing going on here is a loop that sources all files in ~/.bash/ . I just upgraded Mint and it was kind enough to overwrite my .bashrc, that made me decide to have it as minimal as possible so I can easily restore it if something similar happens.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much about distros and I have not had any problems with Mint till this happened. But it is so poor design to overwrite .</description>

      <description>One of the most classic dotfiles, .Xresources. I have gotten most ideas on from the r/unixporn wiki. I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get &amp;ldquo;short name&amp;rdquo; for the includes to work, which annoys me a bit..</description>

      <description>This is part of my anti-DM suite. The stuff I want to happen just before i3 loads up, goes here.
Starting urxvt in daemon mode is really nice and makes it consume less resources and start much faster.
I use hsetroot to set the desktop background to a minimal tiled pattern and a fetch color from Xresources.
The Seba keyboard layout keeps me sane!
I use sxhkd to remap the back button of the mouse to backspace.</description>
