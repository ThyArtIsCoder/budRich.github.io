      <description>put your windows in a zen mode for a zen mood When run, this script puts the active window between two ghosts (centered). if the window already is &amp;ldquo;zen&amp;rdquo;, move it back to its original workspace. If the window is not in zen but another window is, both of them will be zen in a tabbed container.
I made a post on /r/unixporn where you can view an animated gif of i3zen in action.</description>

      <description>mtm = Move To Mark When launched without flags, i3mtm checks floating status of current window. If it is tiled, the window becomes floating. if it is floating, a search for marks is done if no marks are found, window becomes tiled. otherwise a dmenu asks for a mark to move window to. if no selection is made, window is tiled but not moved. otherwise window is tiled and moved to selected mark.</description>

      <description>wrapper for the ghost window function in i3wm
i3-msg has an undocumented function (open) that creates empty containers, or as I call them: ghosts. Since these empty containers doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any windows there is no instance/class/title to identify them, making it difficult to control them. They do however have a con_id and I found the easiest way to keep track of the ghosts is to mark them. That is what this script does, it creates a ghost get its con_id and mark it.</description>
