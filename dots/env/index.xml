      <description>My environment dotfiles is where i setup my, well, environment. i3env are environment variables that i have invented myself and most of them are settings for various i3ass scripts. I could have put them in .bashrc, but I source them from ~/.xinitrc since all of them are specific to a graphical environment.
Similarly export are environment variables that are sourced in ~/.bashrc.
I try to keep most of my xsession related always start executions in ~/.</description>
