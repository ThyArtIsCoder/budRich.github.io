      <description>There are three dotfiles that configures thunar. ~/.config/Thunar/accels.scm is where the keybindings (or accelerators, as keybindings is called in GTK) are defined.
The file is autogenerated, so any formatting to the file is pointless. To modify an existing keybinding, one just remove the ; and change the last string of the line to the desired keycombination.
I have filed a bugreport/feature-request regarding the keybindings: https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14069
~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/thunar.xml contains hidden settings for thunar.</description>
