      <description>This is another keyplayer in the anti-DM suit.
The read -rsn1 -t2 input waits two seconds for a key-press before it starts X and i3. If I press 1 I stay in the wonderful tty environment. If I press 3 lightDM is launched and I enter my normal Peppermint OS desktop. If I press 2 or wait 2 seconds, i3 starts. Before this happens I have to login, in text mode and look at my issue.</description>

      <description>Only thing going on here is a loop that sources all files in ~/.bash/ . I just upgraded Mint and it was kind enough to overwrite my .bashrc, that made me decide to have it as minimal as possible so I can easily restore it if something similar happens.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care so much about distros and I have not had any problems with Mint till this happened. But it is so poor design to overwrite .</description>

      <description>One of the most classic dotfiles, .Xresources. I have gotten most ideas on from the r/unixporn wiki. I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get &amp;ldquo;short name&amp;rdquo; for the includes to work, which annoys me a bit..</description>

      <description>This is part of my anti-DM suite. The stuff I want to happen just before i3 loads up, goes here.
Starting urxvt in daemon mode is really nice and makes it consume less resources and start much faster.
I use hsetroot to set the desktop background to a minimal tiled pattern and a fetch color from Xresources.
The Seba keyboard layout keeps me sane!
I use sxhkd to remap the back button of the mouse to backspace.</description>
